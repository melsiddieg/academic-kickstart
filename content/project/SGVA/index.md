The Sudanese Genetic Variation Archive is the first comprehensive resource for  medical and population genetics in Sudan. It catalogs more than 4 million genetic variants including single nucleotide variants (SNPs) and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) from more than 300 Sudanese individuals. It is the first project to calculate the local Sudanese allele frequencies for common and rare variants including many novel variants that had not been previously reported in other populations. This resource is a big step toward achieving the goals of precision and personalized medicine in Sudan, enabling clinicians and researchers to query this wealth of genetic data with ease and in an optimized and user-friendly manner that facilitates medical and clinical genetics research.
