The aim of the project is to create an African Genome Variation Database (AGVD) that will provide searching and visualisation capabilities for African genetic data. A public version will contain only publicly available data and potentially aggregate summaries for restricted access data. If required, an internal version will include more detailed de-identified genotype data for consortium use.
